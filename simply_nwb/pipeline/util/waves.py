    """
    Take a square wave and find the start and stop times of each pulse, along with the state
    So a wave lke ⨅__⨅__⨅ would give [(0,1,1),(1,3,0),(3,4,1),(4,5,0)]


    :param arr: Array of the squarewave
    :param minval: minimum value for the state change threshold, if None will infer
    :param maxval: maximum value for the state change threshold, if None will infer
    :param epsilon: minimum difference between minval/maxval and current index of the wave
    :param handle_dropped_signal: Sometimes during a pulse a signal can be dropped. e.g. a signal that is supposed to look like 000111000 can end up as 000101000 and will need to be corrected
    :param dropped_width: Any change in signal less than or equal to 3 indexes long will be smoothed out
    :param warn_on_large_gaps: If set, if there is any gap larger than 'warn_on_large_gaps' times larger than the median gap size, it will throw a warning message, set to None to silence
